# Fake-News-Prediction


# Overview
Fake News Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to classify news articles as either fake or real. The model is trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and is implemented in Python using libraries such as `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, and `pandas`.

# Features
- Preprocessing of textual data using `nltk`
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
- Training a machine learning model to classify news articles
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy metrics

# Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-prediction.git
   cd fake-news-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled fake and real news articles. You can use datasets such as:
- [Fake News Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- [LIAR Dataset](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/software.html)

# Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The script cleans and tokenizes the text data using `nltk`.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converts text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training**: Trains a classifier such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
4. **Prediction**: Classifies new articles as real or fake.

Run the model with:
```bash
python fake_news_detector.py
```

# Model Performance
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results may vary depending on the dataset used.
